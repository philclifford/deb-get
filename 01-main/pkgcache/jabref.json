Linux: `$home/.cache/jabref/logs/version`, Windows: `%APPDATA%\\..\\Local\\harawata\\jabref\\version\\logs`, Mac: `Users/.../Library/Logs/jabref/version`\r\n- We added an importer for Citavi backup files, support \".ctv5bak\" and \".ctv6bak\" file formats. [#8322](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8322)\r\n- We added a feature to drag selected entries and drop them to other opened inactive library tabs [koppor521](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/521).\r\n- We added support for the [biblatex-apa](https://github.com/plk/biblatex-apa) legal entry types `Legislation`, `Legadminmaterial`, `Jurisdiction`, `Constitution` and `Legal` [#8931](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8931)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- The file column in the main table now shows the corresponding defined icon for the linked file [8930](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8930).\r\n- We improved the color of the selected entries and the color of the summary in the Import Entries Dialog in the dark theme. [#7927](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7927)\r\n- We upgraded to Lucene 9.3 for the fulltext search.\r\n  Thus, the now created search index cannot be read from older versions of JabRef anylonger.\r\n  ⚠️ JabRef will recreate the index in a new folder for new files and this will take a long time for a huge library.\r\n  Moreover, switching back and forth JabRef versions and meanwhile adding PDFs also requires rebuilding the index now and then.\r\n  [#8868](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8868)\r\n- We improved the Latex2Unicode conversion [#8639](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8639)\r\n- Writing BibTeX data into a PDF (XMP) removes braces. [#8452](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8452)\r\n- Writing BibTeX data into a PDF (XMP) does not write the `file` field.\r\n- Writing BibTeX data into a PDF (XMP) considers the configured keyword separator (and does not use \",\" as default any more)\r\n- The Medline/Pubmed search now also supports the [default fields and operators for searching](https://docs.jabref.org/collect/import-using-online-bibliographic-database#search-syntax). [forum#3554](https://discourse.jabref.org/t/native-pubmed-search/3354)\r\n- We improved group expansion arrow that prevent it from activating group when expanding or collapsing.

[koppor#570](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/570)\r\n- When JabRef encounters `% Encoding: UTF-8` header, it is kept during writing (and not removed). [#8964](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8964)\r\n- We replace characters which cannot be decoded using the specified encoding by a (probably another) valid character. This happens if JabRef detects the wrong charset (e.g., UTF-8 instead of Windows 1252). One can use the [Integrity Check](https://docs.jabref.org/finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkintegrity) to find those characters.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- We fixed an issue where the user could not rate an entry in the main table when an entry was not yet ranked.

[#8939](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8939)\r\n- We fixed a bug where files that were deleted in the source bibtex file were kept in the index. [#8962](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8962)\r\n- We fixed \"Error while sending to JabRef\" when the browser extension interacts with JabRef.
