Firstly, now you can customize the toolbar and display or hide most elements depending on your preferences. To do so, head over into the new tab in the preferences window. Secondly, you can now navigate the file tree as well with your arrow keys. To collapse or uncollapse directories, you can use the left and right arrow keys. Thirdly, we have added scroll buttons which will come in handy for those of you who cannot or do not want to scroll through the tabbar horizontally.\r\n\r\nBesides these new features, we have again fixed a bunch of bugs and improved working with the app considerably.
